# Music-Genre-Recognition
In this project we apply various machine learning methods to automatically classify different musical genres from audio files. 

We classify the audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain.  
For this project we use the GTZAN genre classification dataset considered the most relevant for the music genre classification project as it was collected for this task only.
