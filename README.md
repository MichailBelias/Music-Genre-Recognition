# Music-Genre-Recognition
In this tutorial we are going to develop a deep learning project to automatically classify different musical genres from audio files. We will classify these audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain.  For this project we need a dataset of audio tracks having similar size and similar frequency range. GTZAN genre classification dataset is the most recommended dataset for the music genre classification project and it was collected for this task only.
